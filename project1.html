                <p>As the very first project of GMTC Japan, we decided to create our official website from scratch. Since two of our founding members already had basic knowledge of HTML, we thought it would be the perfect opportunity for the entire team to learn web development together and build something meaningful that represents us.</p>
                <p>We started by designing the layout on Figma, carefully choosing the color scheme, fonts, and structure to match our organization. Our goal was to create something simple, readable, and uniquely “ours.” Once the design was finalized, we moved on to implementation using HTML and CSS, dividing tasks based on each person’s skills and learning goals. Since most of us were new to building websites, we ran into lots of challenges—from layout bugs to responsive design issues—but we kept pushing forward.</p>
                <p>After about four months of work, we successfully launched the website using GitHub Pages, and later connected it to a custom domain. This was more than just a coding project—it taught us the importance of teamwork, communication, and perseverance.</p>
